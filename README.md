This is a project for Treehouse, using their supplied (stock)  photos -  created a photo gallery using css, added search and lightbox feature using jquery. Mobile responsive, very simple layout using strictly flexbox.
<br>
Not much  vanilla js used, almost all jquery.

I plan to rewrite  this project in the future using my own travel pictures and using vanilla javascript
